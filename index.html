      <h1>The History of HTML: Evolution of the Web’s Backbone</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the foundation of the World Wide
          Web, allowing developers to create structured webpages. From its
          humble beginnings in the early 1990s to the advanced versions we use
          today, HTML has evolved significantly.

        <h2>The Birth of HTML</h2>
        <h3>Tim Berners-Lee and the First HTML Version (1989-1991)</h3>
        <p>
          HTML was invented by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, a British
          scientist working at CERN. His goal was to create a system for sharing
          documents across computers. This led to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The first <strong>HTML prototype</strong> (1989)</li>
          <li>The first <strong>web browser and server</strong> (1990)</li>
          <li>The <strong>official release of HTML</strong> (1991)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key Features of Early HTML (1991)</h3>
        <p>The first version of HTML was simple and included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Basic <strong>text formatting</strong> (headings, paragraphs, lists)
          </li>
          <li>Hyperlinks (<strong>the core of the web</strong>)</li>
          <li>Support for inline images and simple tables</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>The Evolution of HTML: Major Versions</h2>
        <h3>HTML 2.0 (1995)</h3>
        <p>The first standardized version of HTML, introducing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forms for user input</li>
          <li>Tables for better layout</li>
          <li>Image maps</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML 3.2 (1997)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>First W3C standard</li>
          <li>Support for <strong>Javascript</strong></li>
          <li>Introduction of <strong>CSS support</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>HTML 4.0 (1997-1999)</h3>
        <p>This version brought:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Separation of content and design</strong> via
            <strong>CSS</strong>
          </li>
          <li>New form elements like <code>&lt;button&gt;</code></li>
          <li>Support for <strong>international characters</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Rise of Modern HTML</h2>
        <h3>XHTML (2000)</h3>
        <p>A stricter version of HTML based on <strong>XML,</strong> designed for cleaner coding. However, it was considered too rigid and never gained wide adoption.</p>
    <h3>HTML5 (2014 - Present)</h3>
    <p>The most significant update to HTML, bringing:</p>
    <p><strong>Key Features of HTML5:</strong>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Native multimedia</strong> support
      </li>
      <li><strong>Semantic elements</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Canvas and SVG</strong> for graphics and animations</li>
      <li><strong>Improved forms</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Offline support</strong> through <strong>Service Workers</strong></li>
    </ol>

      <p>As HTML evolved, the way web pages were processed and displayed became more sophisticated. This led to the development of the <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> and advanced <strong>Rendering Engines,</strong> which play a crucial role in how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.</p>
      <h3>Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
      <p>The <strong>DOM</strong> represents an HTML document as a tree-like structure where every element (tags, attributes, and text) is treated as an object. This allows JavaScript to dynamically interact with the page by modifying elements in real time.</p>
  <p>For example, a JavaScript script can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Change the text inside an <font color=”green″>< h1 ></font> tag</li>
    <li>Modify CSS properties dynamically</li>
    <li>Add or remove elements from the page</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rendering Engines
</h3>
<p>Each web browser has its own <strong>rendering engine</strong> that interprets HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display a web page. Some of the most well-known engines include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Blink</strong>  (used by Chrome and Edge)</li>
<li><strong>WebKit</strong> (used by Safari)</li>
<li><strong>Gecko</strong> (used by Firefox)</li>
</ul>
<p>These engines follow a structured process:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Parsing HTML and CSS</strong> into a render tree</li>
  <li><strong>Layout calculation</strong> to determine element positions</li>
  <li><strong>Painting</strong> the final output on the screen</li>
</ol>
<p>The efficiency of rendering engines has improved significantly over time, leading to faster, more responsive web pages with advanced features such as <u><font color=”blue″>animations</font></u>, 3D graphics, and real-time interactions.</p>
<h2>The future of HTML</h2>
<h3>What’s Next?
</h3><p>"The Web does not just connect machines, it connects people."</p>
<p>The future of HTML includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved Web Components</strong> for better reusability</li>
<li><strong>Better accessibility</strong> standards</li>
<li><strong>AI and automation</strong> integration in <u><font color=”blue″>web applications</font></u></li>
</ul>
